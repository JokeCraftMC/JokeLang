## For Contributors

To help translate:

1. **See what's missing:**
   - Check the files on GitHub
   - Look for strings that match English (not yet translated)
   - Or ask maintainer to generate a complete file with `TODO:` markers

2. **Translate:**
   - Click the language file (e.g., `de_DE.json`)
   - Click ✏️ pencil icon to edit
   - Find untranslated lines
   - Translate them (keep tags like `<primary>` and `{player}` unchanged!)
   - Submit Pull Request

3. **Tips:**
   - You don't need to translate everything at once
   - Even translating 10 lines helps!
   - Untranslated lines will show in English (that's okay!)
