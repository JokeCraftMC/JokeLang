# 🤝 Contributing to JokeLang

Thank you for helping translate JokeCraft! 🌍

## 📝 Quick Guide

1. **Pick a language file** (e.g., `de_DE.json`, `fr_FR.json`)
2. **Translate the words** (keep tags like `<primary>` and `{player}` unchanged)
3. **Submit a Pull Request** or open an Issue

## ✅ Before Submitting

- [ ] Only translated the **words**, not the color tags or placeholders
- [ ] Kept `<tags>` exactly as they were
- [ ] Kept `{placeholders}` exactly as they were
- [ ] Kept `\n` line breaks
- [ ] JSON is valid (no syntax errors)
- [ ] Tested locally if possible

## 🎯 Translation Checklist

### Good Translation ✅
```json
"welcome": "<primary>Bienvenue, {player}!</primary>"
```

### Bad Translation ❌
```json
"welcome": "<primaire>Bienvenue, {joueur}!</primaire>"
```
*(Changed the tag and placeholder - don't do this!)*
